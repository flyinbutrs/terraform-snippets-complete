You can\nalso retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation\non that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.

You can either assign a\nprivate IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically assign one.\nYou can choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To retrieve the\naddresses, use the [ListVnicAttachments](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/VnicAttachment/ListVnicAttachments)\noperation to get the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call\n[GetVnic](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/GetVnic) with the VNIC ID.

        "description": "Other supported legacy names/aliases: `oci_core_virtual_network`  This resource provides the Vcn resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service. The VCN automatically comes with a default route table, default security list, and default set of DHCP options.\nFor managing these resources, see [Managing Default VCN Resources](/docs/providers/oci/guides/managing_default_resources.html) Creates a new Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). For more information, see\n[VCNs and Subnets](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVCNs.htm). For the VCN you must specify a single, contiguous IPv4 CIDR block. Oracle recommends using one of the\nprivate IP address ranges specified in [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) (10.0.0.0/8,\n172.16/12, and 192.168/16). Example: 172.16.0.0/16. The CIDR block can range from /16 to /30, and it\nmust not overlap with your on-premises network. You can't change the size of the VCN after creation. For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the VCN to\nreside. Consult an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure administrator in your organization if you're not sure which\ncompartment to use. Notice that the VCN doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the subnets or other\nNetworking Service components. For more information about compartments and access control, see\n[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm). For information about OCIDs, see\n[Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm). You may optionally specify a *display name* for the VCN, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to\nbe unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information. You can also add a DNS label for the VCN, which is required if you want the instances to use the\nInterent and VCN Resolver option for DNS in the VCN. For more information, see\n[DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm). The VCN automatically comes with a default route table, default security list, and default set of DHCP options.\nThe OCID for each is returned in the response. You can't delete these default objects, but you can change their\ncontents (that is, change the route rules, security list rules, and so on). The VCN and subnets you create are not accessible until you attach an internet gateway or set up an IPSec VPN\nor FastConnect.

        "description": "This resource provides the User resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service. Creates a new user in your tenancy. For conceptual information about users, your tenancy, and other\nIAM Service components, see [Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm). You must specify your tenancy's OCID as the compartment ID in the request object (remember that the\ntenancy is simply the root compartment). Notice that IAM resources (users, groups, compartments, and\nsome policies) reside within the tenancy itself, unlike cloud resources such as compute instances,\nwhich typically reside within compartments inside the tenancy. For information about OCIDs, see\n[Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm). You must also specify a *name* for the user, which must be unique across all users in your tenancy\nand cannot be changed. Allowed characters: No spaces. Only letters, numerals, hyphens, periods,\nunderscores, +, and @. If you specify a name that's already in use, you'll get a 409 error.\nThis name will be the user's login to the Console. You might want to pick a\nname that your company's own identity system (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, etc.) already uses.\nIf you delete a user and then create a new user with the same name, they'll be considered different\nusers because they have different OCIDs. You must also specify a *description* for the user (although it can be an empty string).\nIt does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with\n[UpdateUser](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/User/UpdateUser). You can use the field to provide the user's\nfull name, a description, a nickname, or other information to generally identify the user. A new user has no permissions until you place the user in one or more groups (see\n[AddUserToGroup](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/UserGroupMembership/AddUserToGroup)). If the user needs to\naccess the Console, you need to provide the user a password (see\n[CreateOrResetUIPassword](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/UIPassword/CreateOrResetUIPassword)).\nIf the user needs to access the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure REST API, you need to upload a\npublic API signing key for that user (see\n[Required Keys and OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm) and also\n[UploadApiKey](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/ApiKey/UploadApiKey)). **Important:** Make sure to inform the new user which compartment(s) they have access to.",
