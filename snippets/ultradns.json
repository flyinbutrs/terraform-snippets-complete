For more information on managing snapshots and how they work in VMware, see\n[here][ext-vm-snapshot-management]. ~> **NOTE:** A snapshot in VMware differs from traditional disk snapshots in\nthat the actual running state of the virtual machine can be taken with the\nsnapshot as well, all non-independent disks are included in the snapshot\n(including any disks that have been attached externally but are not\nindependent), and VM and disk activity post-snapshot is not included in the\noriginal state. Use this resource with care! VMware nor HashiCorp recommends\nretaining snapshots for a extended period of time and does NOT recommend using\nthem as as backup feature.
