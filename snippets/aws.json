Please read this document in its entirety before using this\nresource. The `aws_default_security_group` behaves differently from normal resources, in that\nTerraform does not _create_ this resource, but instead \"adopts\" it\ninto management. We can do this because these default security groups cannot be\ndestroyed, and are created with a known set of default ingress/egress rules. When Terraform first adopts the Default Security Group, it **immediately removes all\ningress and egress rules in the Security Group**. It then proceeds to create any rules specified in the\nconfiguration. This step is required so that only the rules specified in the\nconfiguration are created. This resource treats it's inline rules as absolute; only the rules defined\ninline are created, and any additions/removals external to this resource will\nresult in diff shown. For these reasons, this resource is incompatible with the\n`aws_security_group_rule` resource.

        "description": "Provides a resource to create a VPC routing table. ~> **NOTE on Route Tables and Routes:** Terraform currently\nprovides both a standalone [Route resource](route.html) and a Route Table resource with routes\ndefined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Route Table with in-line routes\nin conjunction with any Route resources. Doing so will cause\na conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules. ~> **NOTE on `gateway_id` and `nat_gateway_id`:** The AWS API is very forgiving with these two\nattributes and the `aws_route_table` resource can be created with a NAT ID specified as a Gateway ID attribute.\nThis _will_ lead to a permanent diff between your configuration and statefile, as the API returns the correct\nparameters in the returned route table. If you're experiencing constant diffs in your `aws_route_table` resources,\nthe first thing to check is whether or not you're specifying a NAT ID instead of a Gateway ID, or vice-versa. ~> **NOTE on `propagating_vgws` and the `aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation` resource:**\nIf the `propagating_vgws` argument is present, it's not supported to _also_\ndefine route propagations using `aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation`, since\nthis resource will delete any propagating gateways not explicitly listed in\n`propagating_vgws`.
